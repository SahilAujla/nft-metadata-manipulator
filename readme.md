# NFT Metadata Manipulator
Often times when we use tools like Hashlips art engine to generate NFT metadata there are certain attributes that are added to all the metadata files that we don't need in our collection. For example the `compiler` attribute or the `date` attribute.

This script can help you add/remove any attributes to thousands of your metadata files at once!

Just place your metadata files under the json folder, set your configuration in the `index.js` file and run the `index.js` script to update your metadata.
